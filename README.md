# Goal

The goal of this repository is to illustrate how easy it can be to use Azure Cognitive Services to perform tasks like speech recognition, form recognition, text recognition from images, and more. 

With the exception of this README, the files included in this repository are Jupyter notebooks, which you can download and run locally. Each notebook is stand alone, and can be used for learning purposes or to experiment with a specific service. 

## Things to keep in mind

* You'll need an Azure subscription to run any of the notebooks in this repo. In most cases, the *free* subscription will do the trick. If a paid (or standard) subscription is required, it'll be called out in the prerequiusites of the notebook.
* For each service, you'll need to create a resource in the Azure portal. I'll include links direcly to the create blade in each notebook.
  * In most cases you'll need some combination of `key`, `region`, and/or `endpoint`. These are all available in the Azure portal, under your resource, in the *Keys and endpoints* menu.
