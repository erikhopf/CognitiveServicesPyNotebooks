    THE GRIZZLY


Nearly half a century has gone since I lived among these scenes and made my
observations on the grand Old Bear of the Mountains.

Many new conditions have in that time developed, have changed the course of
history. But the biggest, saddest change of all is that the Grizzly Bear,
the most magnificent, dignified, and powerful beast of the wild, heroic
West, is gone.

There may be a few individuals about Yellowstone Park or other great
havens, but the Grizzly Bear as the wide-wandering monarch of the hills has
gone the way of the Dodo.

It is just possible that in this last and latest time a newborn strong and
growing sentiment will come to the rescue, will prompt us to seek out and
preserve the last remnant, just as long-belated appreciation came at final
stance to save for later generations the Great Sequoia Tree, when man's
blind avarice had all but wiped it out. Good men are now at work with
better thoughts, and reverence for the masterpieces, the giants of
creation's world. It may be that this newer thought may come in force and
save the grand old Bear while yet it curbs his power for harm. This is my
hope and prayer; this is the sentiment unwritten, but expressed, in my
Story of the Grizzly.
